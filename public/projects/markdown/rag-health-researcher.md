# 🤖 AI Chatbot for Health Research using RAG and LLM

## 🧠 Overview

As part of my internship at **PT. Inti Utama Solusindo**, I worked as a **Machine Learning Engineer** and developed an AI-powered chatbot aimed at assisting **health researchers** in retrieving fast, accurate, and contextual information. The system utilizes **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to generate intelligent responses based on structured knowledge extracted from open-access health journals.
