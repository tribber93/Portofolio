# 🏡 Assetify: Know the Price, Make it Wise!

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Property demand in Jakarta continues to rise along with population growth and urban infrastructure development. However, **house price fluctuations**—influenced by factors like **location**, **facilities**, and **economic conditions**—make it difficult for buyers and investors to estimate property value accurately.

**Assetify** is here to help!  
This app leverages data and machine learning to provide **accurate housing price predictions** based on user input.
